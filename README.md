# Quickbite-FoodDelivery
This project is a Spring Boot application structured with layered architecture to manage e-commerce operations. It includes configuration classes for environment setup, entity models representing database tables, DTOs for data transfer between frontend and backend, and mappers to convert between entities and DTOs. Repositories handle data access with Spring Data JPA, services implement business logic such as discount calculation and order management, and REST resources expose endpoints for frontend interaction. The design ensures clean separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.
